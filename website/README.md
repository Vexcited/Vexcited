# Vexcited's Website [![Deploy Website](https://github.com/Vexcited/Vexcited/actions/workflows/website-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://vexcited.vercel.app/)

Deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

You can see the production build on [my website](https://vexcited.vercel.app/).

I deploy to Vercel manually with `vercel-action` to prevent a new deploy on README updates for WakaTime.

## Installation

Clone the repo, `cd website` and run `yarn` to install depedencies.
Then type `yarn dev` to start Vite development server
or type `yarn build` to run the Vite build script (build folder will be `/dist`).

## Contribute

Before commiting, run `yarn lint` to lint the code and fix the styling errors with `yarn lint --fix`.
