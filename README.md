**If you’re looking for my projects, they’ve moved to [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz).**<br>
You can now find everything listed on my personal seed <https://code.vexcited.com>.

I still keep mirrors on GitHub so it’s easy for everyone to send pull requests.<br>
PRs opened here will be merged here and then synced to Radicle.

Maybe we’ll cross paths here again one day.
